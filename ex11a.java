THEORY:
Go Back N is a connection oriented transmission. The sender transmits the frames continuously. Each frame in
the buffer has a sequence number starting from 1 and increasing up to the window size. The sender has a
window i.e. a buffer to store the frames. This buffer size is the number of frames to be transmitted continuously.
The size of the window depends on the protocol designer.
ALGORITHM :
1. The source node transmits the frames continuously.
2. Each frame in the buffer has a sequence number starting from 1 and increasing up to the window size.
3. The source node has a window i.e. a buffer to store the frames. This buffer size is the number of frames
to be transmitted continuously.
4. The size of the window depends on the protocol designer.
5. For the first frame, the receiving node forms a positive acknowledgement if the frame is received
without error.
6. If subsequent frames are received without error (up to window size) cumulative positive
acknowledgement is formed.
7. If the subsequent frame is received with error, the cumulative acknowledgment error-free frames are
transmitted. If in the same window two frames or more frames are received with error, the second and
the subsequent error frames are neglected. Similarly even the frames received without error after the
receipt of a frame with error are neglected.
8. The source node retransmits all frames of window from the first error frame.
9. If the frames are errorless in the next transmission and if the acknowledgment is error free, the window
slides by the number of error-free frames being transmitted.
10. If the acknowledgment is transmitted with error, all the frames of window at source are retransmitted,
and window doesnâ€™t slide.
11. This concept of repeating the transmission from the first error frame in the window is called as
GOBACKN transmission flow control protocol
